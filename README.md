# Project Overview: Netflix for Researchers

In the ever-expanding realm of academic research, with approximately 1.8 million papers published annually, the challenge lies in enabling users to efficiently navigate this vast sea of knowledge. The proposed solution, termed "Netflix for Researchers," aims to streamline the search process, providing users with an algorithm-driven platform that considers user ratings and paper citations to deliver personalized and popular content.

# Key Features:

## Query-Based Searching:

#### Users input queries into the search field, and papers are ranked using TF-IDF similarity, focusing on both content and title relevance.
#### Enhances search intuitiveness by presenting results based on user ratings and paper citations, reducing search time.

## Field Recommendation (Trending Fields):

#### Utilizes K-nearest neighbors to recommend trending fields like Data Science and Machine Learning.
#### Tailors recommendations for new and existing users, incorporating average ratings from existing users for trending fields.
#### For existing users, considers ratings from their closest neighbors, prioritizing fields with high ratings and citations.

## Paper Recommendation (Trending Papers):

#### Applies a similar approach to field recommendation, with a focus on user ratings over citations.
#### Recommends papers based on what like-minded users are enjoying.
#### Collects user feedback (ratings: 0 to 5) for continuous improvement and personalization.

# Benefits:

#### Decreased Search Time: Efficient algorithmic ranking reduces the time users spend searching for relevant papers.
#### Similar Interest Matching: Delivers papers based on user preferences and ratings, fostering a sense of similarity among users.
#### Trending Fields Display: Highlights popular and emerging fields, catering to both new and existing users.
#### User-Friendly UI: Ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience for enhanced usability.
#### Context-Based Searching: Takes into account content and title relevance, providing contextually relevant results.

# Limitations and Future Developments:
While the algorithm may face challenges with increased database size, leading to potential delays in search times, the project envisions transitioning to advanced Deep Learning models like VAE (Variational Autoencoders) to address scalability and further enhance recommendation accuracy.

In summary, "Netflix for Researchers" presents a sophisticated solution to the information overload in academic research, leveraging collaborative filtering, user preferences, and trending fields to create a personalized and efficient platform for researchers seeking valuable and popular content.
