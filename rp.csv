0, Counterfactually Evaluating Explanations in Recommender Systems,Yuanshun Yao Chong Wang Hang Li, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Modern recommender systems face an increasing need to explain theirrecommendations. Despite considerable progress in this area, evaluating thequality of explanations remains a significant challenge for researchers andpractitioners. Prior work mainly conducts human study to evaluate explanationquality, which is usually expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human bias.In this paper, we propose an offline evaluation method that can be computedwithout human involvement. To evaluate an explanation, our method quantifiesits counterfactual impact on the recommendation. To validate the effectivenessof our method, we carry out an online user study. We show that, compared toconventional methods, our method can produce evaluation scores more correlatedwith the real human judgments, and therefore can serve as a better proxy forhuman evaluation. In addition, we show that explanations with high evaluationscores are considered better by humans. Our findings highlight the promisingdirection of using the counterfactual approach as one possible way to evaluaterecommendation explanations.    ",02-03-2022
1, Analytical Solutions for the Inverse Problem within Gradual Semantics,Nir Oren Bruno Yun Assaf Libman Murilo S Baptista, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Gradual semantics within abstract argumentation associate a numeric scorewith every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability ofthis argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can bederived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks,many utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associatedwith each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradualsemantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentationframework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentationframework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, andidentifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtainthe desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problemnumerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identifyappropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class ofgradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverseproblem. Unlike the current state-of-the-art, such an analytic approach canrapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result,we are able to prove several important properties which previous work had posedas conjectures.    ",02-03-2022
2, Controlling the Focus of Pretrained Language Generation Models,Jiabao Ji Yoon Kim James Glass Tianxing He, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  The finetuning of pretrained transformer-based language generation models aretypically conducted in an end-to-end manner, where the model learns to attendto relevant parts of the input by itself. However, there does not exist amechanism to directly control the model's focus. This work aims to develop acontrol mechanism by which a user can select spans of context as ""highlights""for the model to focus on, and generate relevant output. To achieve this goal,we augment a pretrained model with trainable ""focus vectors"" that are directlyapplied to the model's embeddings, while the model itself is kept fixed. Thesevectors, trained on automatic annotations derived from attribution methods, actas indicators for context importance. We test our approach on two coregeneration tasks: dialogue response generation and abstractive summarization.We also collect evaluation data where the highlight-generation pairs areannotated by humans. Our experiments show that the trained focus vectors areeffective in steering the model to generate outputs that are relevant touser-selected highlights.    ",02-03-2022
3, On the Configuration of More and Less Expressive Logic Programs,Carmine Dodaro Marco Maratea Mauro Vallati, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  The decoupling between the representation of a certain problem, i.e., itsknowledge model, and the reasoning side is one of main strong points ofmodel-based Artificial Intelligence (AI). This allows, e.g. to focus onimproving the reasoning side by having advantages on the whole solving process.Further, it is also well-known that many solvers are very sensitive to evensyntactic changes in the input. In this paper, we focus on improving thereasoning side by taking advantages of such sensitivity. We consider twowell-known model-based AI methodologies, SAT and ASP, define a number ofsyntactic features that may characterise their inputs, and use automatedconfiguration tools to reformulate the input formula or program. Results of awide experimental analysis involving SAT and ASP domains, taken from respectivecompetitions, show the different advantages that can be obtained by using inputreformulation and configuration.

4, PKGM A Pretrained Knowledge Graph Model for Ecommerce Application,Wen Zhang ChiMan Wong Ganqinag Ye Bo Wen Hongting Zhou Wei Zhang Huajun Chen, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  In recent years, knowledge graphs have been widely applied as a uniform wayto organize data and have enhanced many tasks requiring knowledge. In onlineshopping platform Taobao, we built a billion-scale e-commerce product knowledgegraph. It organizes data uniformly and provides item knowledge services forvarious tasks such as item recommendation. Usually, such knowledge services areprovided through triple data, while this implementation includes (1) tediousdata selection works on product knowledge graph and (2) task model designingworks to infuse those triples knowledge. More importantly, product knowledgegraph is far from complete, resulting error propagation to knowledge enhancedtasks. To avoid these problems, we propose a Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Model(PKGM) for the billion-scale product knowledge graph. On the one hand, it couldprovide item knowledge services in a uniform way with service vectors forembedding-based and item-knowledge-related task models without accessing tripledata. On the other hand, it's service is provided based on implicitly completedproduct knowledge graph, overcoming the common the incomplete issue. We alsopropose two general ways to integrate the service vectors from PKGM intodownstream task models. We test PKGM in five knowledge-related tasks, itemclassification, item resolution, item recommendation, scene detection andsequential recommendation. Experimental results show that PKGM introducessignificant performance gains on these tasks, illustrating the useful ofservice vectors from PKGM.    ",02-03-2022
5, NeuroSymbolic Verification of Deep Neural Networks,Xuan Xie Kristian Kersting Daniel Neider, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),"  Formal verification has emerged as a powerful approach to ensure the safetyand reliability of deep neural networks. However, current verification toolsare limited to only a handful of properties that can be expressed asfirst-order constraints over the inputs and output of a network. Whileadversarial robustness and fairness fall under this category, many real-worldproperties (e.g., ""an autonomous vehicle has to stop in front of a stop sign"")remain outside the scope of existing verification technology. To mitigate thissevere practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifyingneural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to useneural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling theverification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including theone above. Moreover, we demonstrate how neuro-symbolic verification can beimplemented on top of existing verification infrastructure for neural networks,making our framework easily accessible to researchers and practitioners alike.

6, ResponsibleAIbyDesign a Pattern Collection for Designing Responsible AI Systems,Qinghua Lu Liming Zhu Xiwei Xu Jon Whittle, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Although AI has significant potential to transform society, there are seriousconcerns about its ability to behave and make decisions responsibly. Manyethical regulations, principles, and guidelines for responsible AI have beenissued recently. However, these principles are high-level and difficult to putinto practice. In the meantime much effort has been put into responsible AIfrom the algorithm perspective, but they are limited to a small subset ofethical principles amenable to mathematical analysis. Responsible AI issues gobeyond data and algorithms and are often at the system-level crosscutting manysystem components and the entire software engineering lifecycle. Based on theresult of a systematic literature review, this paper identifies one missingelement as the system-level guidance: how to design the architecture ofresponsible AI systems. We present a summary of design patterns that can beembedded into the AI systems as product features to contribute toresponsible-AI-by-design.    ",02-03-2022
7, Computerization of Clinical Pathways A Literature Review and Directions for Future Research,Ayman Alahmar Ola Alkhatib, Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Clinical Pathways (CP) are medical management plans developed to standardizepatient treatment activities, optimize resource usage, reduce expenses, andimprove the quality of healthcare services. Most CPs currently in use arepaper-based documents (i.e., not computerized). CP computerization has been anactive research topic since the inception of CP use in hospitals. Thisliterature review research aims to examine studies that focused on CPcomputerization and offers recommendations for future research in thisimportant research area. Some critical research suggestions includecentralizing computerized CPs in Healthcare Information Systems (HIS), CP termstandardization using international medical terminology systems, developing aglobal CP-specific digital coding system, creating a unified CP meta-ontology,developing independent Clinical Pathway Management Systems (CPMS), andsupporting CPMSs with machine learning sub-systems.

8, HighMMT Towards Modality and Task Generalization for HighModality Representation Learning,Paul Pu Liang Yiwei Lyu Xiang Fan Shengtong Mo Dani Yogatama LouisPhilippe Morency Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Multimedia (cs.MM),"  Learning multimodal representations involves discovering correspondences andintegrating information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data. Whilerecent research has begun to explore the design of more general-purposemultimodal models (contrary to prior focus on domain and modality-specificarchitectures), these methods are still largely focused on a small set ofmodalities in the language, vision, and audio space. In order to accelerategeneralization towards diverse and understudied modalities, we investigatemethods for high-modality (a large set of diverse modalities) andpartially-observable (each task only defined on a small subset of modalities)scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we design a general multimodal modelthat enables multitask and transfer learning: multitask learning with sharedparameters enables stable parameter counts (addressing scalability), andcross-modal transfer learning enables information sharing across modalities andtasks (addressing partial observability). Our resulting model generalizesacross text, image, video, audio, time-series, sensors, tables, and setmodalities from different research areas, improves the tradeoff betweenperformance and efficiency, transfers to new modalities and tasks, and revealssurprising insights on the nature of information sharing in multitask models.We release our code and benchmarks which we hope will present a unifiedplatform for subsequent theoretical and empirical analysis:this https URL.

9, DNDETR Accelerate DETR Training by Introducing Query DeNoising,Feng Li Hao Zhang Shilong Liu Jian Guo Lionel M Ni Lei Zhang, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  We present in this paper a novel denoising training method to speedup DETR(DEtection TRansformer) training and offer a deepened understanding of the slowconvergence issue of DETR-like methods. We show that the slow convergenceresults from the instability of bipartite graph matching which causesinconsistent optimization goals in early training stages. To address thisissue, except for the Hungarian loss, our method additionally feedsground-truth bounding boxes with noises into Transformer decoder and trains themodel to reconstruct the original boxes, which effectively reduces thebipartite graph matching difficulty and leads to a faster convergence. Ourmethod is universal and can be easily plugged into any DETR-like methods byadding dozens of lines of code to achieve a remarkable improvement. As aresult, our DN-DETR results in a remarkable improvement ($+1.9$AP) under thesame setting and achieves the best result (AP $43.4$ and $48.6$ with $12$ and$50$ epochs of training respectively) among DETR-like methods with ResNet-$50$backbone. Compared with the baseline under the same setting, DN-DETR achievescomparable performance with $50\%$ training epochs. Code is available at\url{this https URL}.    ",02-03-2022
10, Pareto Frontier Approximation Network PANet to Solve Biobjective TSP,Ishaan Mehta Sajad Saeedi, Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Travelling salesperson problem (TSP) is a classic resource allocation problemused to find an optimal order of doing a set of tasks while minimizing (ormaximizing) an associated objective function. It is widely used in robotics forapplications such as planning, scheduling etc. In this work, we solve TSP fortwo objectives using reinforcement learning. Often in multi objectiveoptimization problems, the associated objective functions can be conflicting innature. In such cases, the optimality is defined in terms of Pareto optimality.A set of these Pareto Optimal solutions in the objective space form a Paretofront (or frontier). Each solution has its own trade off. } In this work, wepresent PA-Net, a network that generates good approximations of the Paretofront for the bi-objective travelling salesperson problem (BTSP). Firstly, BTSPis converted into a constrained optimization problem. We then train our networkto solve this constrained problem using the Lagrangian relaxation and policygradient. With PA-Net we are able to generate good quality Pareto fronts withfast inference times. Finally, we present the application of PA-Net to findoptimal visiting order in a robotic navigation task/coverage planning.    ",02-03-2022
11, Half Wavelet Attention on MNet for LowLight Image Enhancement,ChiMao Fan TsungJung Liu KuanHsien Liu, Image and Video Processing (eess.IV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Multimedia (cs.MM),"  Low-Light Image Enhancement is a computer vision task which intensifies thedark images to appropriate brightness. It can also be seen as an ill-posedproblem in image restoration domain. With the success of deep neural networks,the convolutional neural networks surpass the traditional algorithm-basedmethods and become the mainstream in the computer vision area. To advance theperformance of enhancement algorithms, we propose an image enhancement network(HWMNet) based on an improved hierarchical model: M-Net+. Specifically, we usea half wavelet attention block on M-Net+ to enrich the features from waveletdomain. Furthermore, our HWMNet has competitive performance results on twoimage enhancement datasets in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.The source code and pretrained model are available atthis https URL.

12, Providing Insights for OpenResponse Surveys via EndtoEnd ContextAware Clustering,Soheil Esmaeilzadeh Brian Williams Davood Shamsi Onar Vikingstad, Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL),"  Teachers often conduct surveys in order to collect data from a predefinedgroup of students to gain insights into topics of interest. When analyzingsurveys with open-ended textual responses, it is extremely time-consuming,labor-intensive, and difficult to manually process all the responses into aninsightful and comprehensive report. In the analysis step, traditionally, theteacher has to read each of the responses and decide on how to group them inorder to extract insightful information. Even though it is possible to groupthe responses only using certain keywords, such an approach would be limitedsince it not only fails to account for embedded contexts but also cannot detectpolysemous words or phrases and semantics that are not expressible in singlewords. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end context-aware framework thatextracts, aggregates, and abbreviates embedded semantic patterns inopen-response survey data. Our framework relies on a pre-trained naturallanguage model in order to encode the textual data into semantic vectors. Theencoded vectors then get clustered either into an optimally tuned number ofgroups or into a set of groups with pre-specified titles. In the former case,the clusters are then further analyzed to extract a representative set ofkeywords or summary sentences that serve as the labels of the clusters. In ourframework, for the designated clusters, we finally provide context-awarewordclouds that demonstrate the semantically prominent keywords within eachgroup. Honoring user privacy, we have successfully built the on-deviceimplementation of our framework suitable for real-time analysis on mobiledevices and have tested it on a synthetic dataset. Our framework reduces thecosts at-scale by automating the process of extracting the most insightfulinformation pieces from survey data.    ",02-03-2022
13, The role of haptic communication in dyadic collaborative object manipulation tasks,Yiming Liu Raz Leib William Dudley Ali Shafti A Aldo Faisal David W Franklin, Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"  Intuitive and efficient physical human-robot collaboration relies on themutual observability of the human and the robot, i.e. the two entities beingable to interpret each other's intentions and actions. This is remedied by amyriad of methods involving human sensing or intention decoding, as well ashuman-robot turn-taking and sequential task planning. However, the physicalinteraction establishes a rich channel of communication through forces, torquesand haptics in general, which is often overlooked in industrial implementationsof human-robot interaction. In this work, we investigate the role of haptics inhuman collaborative physical tasks, to identify how to integrate physicalcommunication in human-robot teams. We present a task to balance a ball at atarget position on a board either bimanually by one participant, or dyadicallyby two participants, with and without haptic information. The task requiresthat the two sides coordinate with each other, in real-time, to balance theball at the target. We found that with training the completion time and numberof velocity peaks of the ball decreased, and that participants gradually becameconsistent in their braking strategy. Moreover we found that the presence ofhaptic information improved the performance (decreased completion time) and ledto an increase in overall cooperative movements. Overall, our results show thathumans can better coordinate with one another when haptic feedback isavailable. These results also highlight the likely importance of hapticcommunication in human-robot physical interaction, both as a tool to inferhuman intentions and to make the robot behaviour interpretable to humans.

In this paper, we study optical flow-basedinterpolation of globally available weather radar images from satellites. Theproposed approach uses deep neural networks for the interpolation of multiplevideo frames, while terrain information is combined with temporarilycoarse-grained precipitation radar observation as inputs for self-supervisedtraining. An experiment with the Meteonet radar precipitation dataset for theflood risk simulation in Aude, a department in Southern France (2018),demonstrated the advantage of the proposed method over a linear interpolationbaseline, with up to 20% error reduction.

Weintroduce WaveY-Net, a hybrid data- and physics-augmented convolutional neuralnetwork that can predict electromagnetic field distributions with ultra fastspeeds and high accuracy for entire classes of dielectric photonic structures.This accuracy is achieved by training the neural network to learn only themagnetic near-field distributions of a system and to use a discrete formalismof Maxwell's equations in two ways: as physical constraints in the lossfunction and as a means to calculate the electric fields from the magneticfields. As a model system, we construct a surrogate simulator for periodicsilicon nanostructure arrays and show that the high speed simulator can bedirectly and effectively used in the local and global freeform optimization ofmetagratings. We anticipate that physics-augmented networks will serve as aviable Maxwell simulator replacement for many classes of photonic systems,transforming the way they are designed.    ",02-03-2022

This phenomenon is called Neural Collapse (NC), which seems to takeplace regardless of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NCunder the mean squared error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence showsthat it performs comparably or even better than the de-facto cross-entropyloss. Under a simplified unconstrained feature model, we provide the firstglobal landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex MSE loss and show that the(only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all othercritical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvaturedirections. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by probingthe optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscapecan be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, ourtheoretical findings are experimentally verified on practical networkarchitectures.    ",02-03-2022

19, Engineering the Neural Automatic Passenger Counter,Nico Jahn Michael Siebert, Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Automatic passenger counting (APC) in public transportation has beenapproached with various machine learning and artificial intelligence methodssince its introduction in the 1970s. While equivalence testing is becoming morepopular than difference detection (Student's t-test), the former is much moredifficult to pass to ensure low user risk. On the other hand, recentdevelopments in artificial intelligence have led to algorithms that promisemuch higher counting quality (lower bias). However, gradient-based methods(including Deep Learning) have one limitation: they typically run into localoptima. In this work, we explore and exploit various aspects of machinelearning to increase reliability, performance, and counting quality. We performa grid search with several fundamental parameters: the selection and size ofthe training set, which is similar to cross-validation, and the initial networkweights and randomness during the training process. Using this experiment, weshow how aggregation techniques such as ensemble quantiles can reduce bias, andwe give an idea of the overall spread of the results. We utilize the testsuccess chance, a simulative metric based on the empirical distribution. Wealso employ a post-training Monte Carlo quantization approach and introducecumulative summation to turn counting into a stationary method and allowunbounded counts.    ",02-03-2022

Here we present a novel MoEarchitecture based on matrix product operators (MPO) from quantum many-bodyphysics. It can decompose an original matrix into central tensors (containingthe core information) and auxiliary tensors (with only a small proportion ofparameters). With the decomposed MPO structure, we can reduce the parameters ofthe original MoE architecture by sharing a global central tensor across expertsand keeping expert-specific auxiliary tensors. We also design the gradient maskstrategy for the tensor structure of MPO to alleviate the overfitting problem.Experiments on the three well-known downstream natural language datasets basedon GPT2 show improved performance and efficiency in increasing model capacity(7.26x fewer parameters with the same amount of experts).

The combination of satellite imagery and machine learninghas the capability to estimate poverty at a level similar to what is achievedwith workhorse methods such as face-to-face interviews and household surveys.An increasingly important issue beyond static estimations is whether thistechnology can contribute to scientific discovery and consequently newknowledge in the poverty and welfare domain. A foundation for achievingscientific insights is domain knowledge, which in turn translates intoexplainability and scientific consistency. We review the literature focusing onthree core elements relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability,and explainability and investigate how they relates to the poverty, machinelearning and satellite imagery nexus. Our review of the field shows that thestatus of the three core elements of explainable machine learning(transparency, interpretability and domain knowledge) is varied and does notcompletely fulfill the requirements set up for scientific insights anddiscoveries. We argue that explainability is essential to support widerdissemination and acceptance of this research, and explainability means morethan just interpretability.    ",02-03-2022
